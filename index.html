    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Synthesis of sarcastic speech: Research on adjusting pitch and energy at keyword level using FastSpeech2</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Author: Weihao Jiang</h3>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This time we studied how to use the FastSpeech2 model to adjust pitch and energy at the keyword level to accurately synthesize sarcastic tone. The research focuses on how to precisely control the acoustic characteristics of speech through deep learning technology, especially in identifying and emphasizing sarcastic keywords in sentences, to enhance the naturalness of speech synthesis and the accuracy of expression. Through a series of experimental settings and data analysis, the study proved that adjusting the pitch and energy of keywords can more effectively improve the naturalness of synthetic sarcastic sentences and the listener's perception compared with the traditional whole sentence adjustment method. This work not only advances the application of natural language processing technology in complex emotional expression, but also provides new methods and perspectives for future human-computer interaction and emotion analysis research.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>In this study, we adopt the FastSpeech2 model to adjust the pitch and energy of keywords to synthesize sarcastic speech. First, use the GPT model to identify potential sarcastic keywords in the sentence. Then, in the FastSpeech2 model, the sarcastic expression is emphasized by modifying the position of the control coefficient in the model acting on pitch and energy, and adjusting it at the keyword level. This method allows us to precisely control certain parts of speech without changing the entire sentence, thereby achieving a more natural and effective sarcastic tone synthesis.</p>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The results of our experiments demonstrated a marked improvement in the naturalness and perceptibility of sarcastic speech when pitch and energy adjustments were made at the keyword level, as opposed to whole sentence adjustments. Listeners were better able to identify and appreciate the intended sarcasm, thus validating the effectiveness of our methodology.</p>
